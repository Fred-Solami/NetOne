# ðŸŽ¯ NETONE INTERVIEW - MANAGER DEMO SETUP

## âœ… **IMMEDIATE DEMO SOLUTION**

Since the manager is remote, here's the quickest professional setup:

---

## ðŸ“± **OPTION 1: LOCAL DEMO (RECOMMENDED)**

### **What to tell the Manager:**
*"I'll demonstrate the full working system during our video call. The backend runs locally for security, and I'll show you both the admin panel and customer experience live."*

### **Demo Flow:**
1. **Start Laravel Backend**: `cd laravel_backend && php artisan serve`
2. **Launch Flutter App**: Show on your screen via screen share
3. **Live Demo**: Register users, place orders, show admin inventory
4. **Show Code Quality**: Brief code walkthrough

## ðŸ“± **OPTION 2: APK WITH MOCK DATA**

If manager insists on APK testing, create version with mock backend:

<function_calls>
<invoke name="edit_files">
<parameter name="title">Create mock API service for offline demo
